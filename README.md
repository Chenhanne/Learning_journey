# EBU6304_SE_G058_Learning Journey


## Project Introduction
Our team will develop a Learning Journey Application for BUPT International School students in a few weeks using agile methods. We will conduct a systematic requirements survey, analysis and design, followed by writing implementation and testing of the software. And we will deliver four major iterations in a planned manner.

## Features
- Students record modules studied
- Students record skills gained
- Students record marks achieved and produce relevant calculation for various purpose (GPA and grade)
- Students record achievements
- Students record roles undertaken (class rep, module rep, volunteer)
- Students record extra curricula performed
- Students import/export their data

## Quick Start: How to run our project
